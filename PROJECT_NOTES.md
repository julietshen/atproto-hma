# AT Protocol HMA Integration - Project Notes

## Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight, efficient integration of Meta's Hasher-Matcher-Actioner (HMA) with AT Protocol applications for content moderation. The solution supports NCMEC hash database scanning and is suitable for small Bluesky PDS hosts and independent AppView operators.

## Development Log

### 2023-03-10: Initial Implementation

#### Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created repository structure
   - Set up basic configuration files (.env.example, requirements.txt)
   - Created Docker and Docker Compose configurations
   - Updated README.md with project details

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Implemented API endpoints for hashing, matching, and actions
   - Created webhook handlers for AT Protocol and HMA integration
   - Developed database models for storing hashes, matches, and actions
   - Implemented client libraries for HMA and AT Protocol
   - Added utility functions for image processing

3. **Documentation**
   - Created architecture document explaining system design
   - Developed integration guide for PDS and AppView operators
   - Added API documentation for developers

#### Architecture

The service follows a layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

#### Key Features Implemented

1. **API Layer**
   - Hash endpoints for processing images
   - Match endpoints for comparing against known databases
   - Action endpoints for taking moderation actions
   - Webhook endpoints for receiving callbacks
   - Status endpoints for monitoring

2. **Service Layer**
   - HMA client for communicating with the HMA service
   - AT Protocol client for interacting with PDS/AppView
   - Image processing utilities for preparing images

3. **Data Layer**
   - Database models for hashes, matches, and actions
   - Database initialization scripts
   - Persistence layer for audit logging

#### Deployment Configuration

- Docker Compose setup with:
  - AT Protocol HMA Integration service
  - HMA service
  - PostgreSQL database

#### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Create end-to-end tests with AT Protocol applications

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed hashes
   - Implement batch processing for high-volume scenarios
   - Optimize database queries for scale

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement more robust authentication
   - Add encryption for sensitive data

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Create API reference documentation
   - Add more examples for different integration scenarios
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Standalone Service Approach**
   - Implemented as a separate service rather than a library to allow for independent scaling
   - Provides a clean separation of concerns between AT Protocol and content moderation

2. **Docker-Based Deployment**
   - Leverages HMA's existing Docker container
   - Simplifies deployment for small teams and indie developers
   - Allows for easy updates when HMA is updated

3. **Webhook Integration**
   - Provides a non-blocking way to integrate with AT Protocol applications
   - Allows for asynchronous processing of images
   - Reduces impact on user experience

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Integration with HMA API**
   - Challenge: Understanding the HMA API and how to properly integrate with it
   - Solution: Created a dedicated client library that abstracts away the complexity

2. **AT Protocol Integration Points**
   - Challenge: Identifying the best points to integrate with AT Protocol
   - Solution: Provided multiple integration options (webhooks, direct API calls)

3. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Challenge: Ensuring the system is robust against failures
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
